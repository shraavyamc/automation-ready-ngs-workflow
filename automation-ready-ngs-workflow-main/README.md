Automation-Ready NGS Library Preparation Workflow (Simulation)
Overview

This repository presents a simulation-based, automation-ready design for an NGS library preparation workflow. The project demonstrates how a manual wet-lab protocol can be translated into structured, machine-executable logic suitable for high-throughput liquid-handling automation environments.

The focus is on workflow structure, reproducibility, QC logic, and scalability, rather than on vendor-specific instrument execution.
